The json files are generated by the Springfox component and downloaded from the running services /swagger page.

Use https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-editor/ to convert the json to yaml (simple cut/paste into the editor).

NB The validation service is still generating schemas with suffixes 'Res' and 'Req'. To remove these, simply remove any schema ending in 'Req' and search/replace both for 'xxxRes' and 'xxxReq' and replace with 'xxx'.
