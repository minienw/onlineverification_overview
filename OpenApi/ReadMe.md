The json files are generated by the Springfox component and downloaded from the running services /swagger page.

The yaml files are based on the definition from the json files. These remove some of the automatically generated /error and fake endpoints used to generate the schemas of the JWK payloads and add the correct Authorization header so that the swagger can be used to test the endpoints using https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-editor/
